# MINI-PROJECT-SPORTS-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CNN
In today’s world of internet, a massive amount of data is getting generated
every day and content-based classification of images is becoming an essential
aspect for efficient retrieval of images and have attracted application in
several fields and one of such field is sports. Sport is an integral part of
everybody’s daily life and it is very important to play the sport with the right
posture and environment otherwise it can lead to medical issues. Computer
vision is playing a vital role in the field of image or video identification and
analysis. It deals with the understanding of machines about images and videos.
Machines these days are capable enough to detect objects, videos, particular
activities, etc. Humans use their eyes and brain to identify things, to sense their
surroundings. Computer vision is a field that provides a similar capability to a
machine. Sports play an important role in everyone’s life. Everyone loves to play
or watch games and sports videos. So, in this work, our aim is to classify different
sports activities into different categories so that this analysis can be used to
explore the required sports-related images [7] for example, nowadays, many
types of research have been going on sports and dataset formation is a very
tedious task. So to make it easier, this analysis seems to be helpful by providing
the desired sports images.
